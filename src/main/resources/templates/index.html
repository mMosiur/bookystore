          Also, something tells me that this account is and <em>administrator</em>.
          You can use your power to e.g. <a th:href="@{/library/manage}">manage library</a>.
          That is, you can add authors/publishers/categories/books as well as delete and edit them and their stock.
          Also you can manage <a th:href="@{/orders/manage}">orders</a>,
          remember to mark them as <em>complete</em> if you have sent the books to the customer.
          You did send them, didn't you? Well, if you make a mistake, you can also mark them as <em>incomplete</em>.

          What else can you do? For example, you can <a th:href="@{/library/browse}">browse the library</a>.
          You can do that even not logged in, as well as add books to your cart.
          But to make an order you will have to log in.
          Don't worry, that won't reset you cart content.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          You can view <a th:href="@{/orders/list}">you order list</a>, go through them and pay for them
          in order for an admin to begin shipping.
